      Some of you have asked us about a registry. If you really do want to buy us gifts, you can find said registry <a href="https://www.amazon.com/wedding/share/cmmandkhvegas">here</a>!
        <big><strong>HOWEVER</strong></big>, you are under zero obligation to buy us anything! The entire concept of a registry is an extremely delicate social nicety that I, personally, fear and despise.

    <p>
      <ul class="faq">
        <li>
          <strong>Q:</strong> Why are you getting married?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A:</strong> Idk, I guess we just wanted to? (The 12 year relationship is probably a factor in this too, if I had to make a guess)
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <strong>Q:</strong> Wait, you guys have been together for 12 years???
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A:</strong> Yup, in one way or another. Nope, we can't really believe it either.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <strong>Q:</strong> Why are you having a livestream?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A:</strong> We're not particularly loaded. None of our friends are particularly loaded either. Also, our venue maxes out at 18 people and we're not having a reception. Since this is going to be a quick, silly wedding in a ridiculous and faraway place, we thought it would be nice to be able to include everyone we love in some way, shape, or form.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <strong>Q:</strong> Why Las Vegas???
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A:</strong> To be completely honest with you, I've wanted to get married in Vegas since I saw Ross and Rachel do it on Friends. Cassandra was game, but vetoed the Elvis wedding I was initially going for. Fair enough, eh?
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <strong>Q:</strong> How long is this wedding going to last? Wedding ceremonies are usually kinda long and boring.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A:</strong> Hopefully about 15 minutes! Also, I'm trying my best to make it funny, for our sake as much as yours.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <strong>Q:</strong> But do I actually have to watch it?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A:</strong> No, of course not. You can say you did, and we'll never know! Muahahaha.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <strong>Q:</strong> Why is this website so shitty?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A:</strong> I built it in about an hour and fifteen minutes.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <strong>Q:</strong> What's your address? I want to send you a card!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A:</strong> Thank you so much in advance for the card! We love cards. If you don't have our address (and don't care to ask), you can direct all cards to:
